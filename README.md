# password-generator

The purpose of this project was to make a password generator that creates random, strong passwords that provide greater security, based off of criteria that the user selects.

## Description

When a user needs a strong password, they can click on the "Generate Password" button on the website. A pop-up will then prompt the user to choose the length of the password, given the number they choose is in between 8-128, they will be then asked to choose if they would like to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric values, and special characters. If they choose no to all, it will alert an error that at least one needs to be chosen (this ensures strength and security of password). When all prompts are answered, a password is then generated that matches the user's selected critera. Once the password is generated, it will be displayed in the text box for the user to use.

## Getting Started

Required program(s) needed is any common internet browser with Javascript enabled in said browser (most browsers already have them installed and enabled).
